introduction.title1= Brief introduction
introduction.title2= Margin Trading
introduction.title3= The security strategy
introduction.title4= Trading market
introduction.txt1= BIEX LIMITED (hereinafter referred as \u201Cthe company\u201D) is an enterprise registered in the region of the British Virgin Islands according to related laws there. The company now runs a website- www.biex.com as well as a related mobile application platform (hereinafter referred as \u201Cthe platform\u201D), at the same time, providing transaction services between digital currencies and likewise on the basis of the platform.
introduction.txt2= Users of BIEX draw on the margin system for capital and currency financing. The introduction of leverage, which makes triple leverage trading possible, contributes to increased profits, but also big risks. The platform has initiated an automatic service for money borrowing and repaying in this market. With the auto-borrowing system, users can skip borrowing operations, so that they can avoid missing the best trading time; With the auto-repaying system, no cases where users forget to pay the debt will ever happen, so are extra interests. The platform also pioneered in adopting an effective calculating mode of debt interests, where interests build on the debt for transaction purpose, and the liabilities frozen in the trust are not counted, which further conduces to leverage usage. The debt interests are calculated at 0 o\u2019clock of Singapore time on a daily basis, when interests of the platform users will all be accrued according to effective debt amounts. (Interest rates will follow the market). Debts generated in entrustment orders and debts generated and repaid at the same day charge no interests.
introduction.txt3= BIEX adopts the entire equity position margin system, and users can not withdraw assets with liabilities, so as to control the risk. The mechanism of position deficiency will be triggered once a user\u2019s asset position can\u2019t reach the level of 110% of the liability position. In this situation, all assets will be used to pay for liabilities, and entrustment prices are calculated afterwards.
introduction.txt4= Considering the security of account assets, BIEX has made it a rule that users need to bound their accounts to mobile phone accounts and Google validator accounts, as well as to set up passwords before the process of deposit, withdrawal and trading. Related settings can be changed in the security center.
introduction.txt5= After the launch of cash, BIEX users can enter into the spot trading market for related transactions. The platform adopts the T+0 trading pattern, where financial commodities can be sold even within 24 hours after the purchasing. The platform also adopts a limited price, which can be the bid price or a price lower than that, as presented in orders. Normally, this kind of orders can be cancelled before settlement, so that users can achieve better bargains. Users will need to pay for service fee if trades are settled, which will be deducted from the transaction amounts. If a user gets bitcoins for selling financial commodities, he or she will also need to use bitcoins to pay for service fee. (The rate used to calculate service fee will follow the market).
